        <h2>USAGE OF ANCHOR TAG IN HTML:</h2>
        <p>The &lt;a&gt;  tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

            <p>The most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt;  element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.</p>
            
            <ul>By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
            
            <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
            <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
            <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
            </ul>
