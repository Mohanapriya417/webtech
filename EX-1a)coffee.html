        <h2>LET US READ ABOUT COFFEE:</h2>
        <p>Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans made from seeds of Coffea plant species. It is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, and is one of the most popular drinks in the world.

From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk and cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.</p>
